        It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle,
        made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants.<br> 
        After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in 
        layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions. </div>
